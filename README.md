Hi, I’m Arczi.

I'm working as a SysOp for last 13 years: Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, networks, VMware etc.

I’m interested in:\
   aviation (virtual pilot on Boeing 737NG with home cockpit),\
   astrophotography (Sky-Watcher Maksutov-Cassegrain 127/1500 telescope with ZWO ASI 462MC planetary camera),\
   space exploration (listen International Space Station with RTL-SDR),\
   and motorcycle trips around Europe.\
   
I’m currently learning Python with Flask, Django, Tkinter and REST API. Then I would like to learn Pandas.

I'd like to find a job as a Junior Python Developer. I would also like to join an interesting startup.
